This file documents detailed implementation notes, testing procedures, and critical gotchas for each completed phase.

## üìã **Documentation Rules**

After completing each section in `IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md`, document:
- **What was implemented** (technical details)
- **How it was tested** (verification commands)
- **Critical gotchas** (footguns and future reference warnings)
- **Lessons learned** (patterns and conventions established)

## ‚úÖ **Phase 1.1: Project Structure Setup*

### üìã **Implementation Details & Testing**

**What was implemented:**
- **TypeScript Library Structure**: Created modular `js/` directory with `client/`, `hooks/`, `components/` subdirectories and proper TypeScript exports
- **Build Pipeline**: TypeScript compiler generates both JS and .d.ts declaration files in `dist/` for library distribution
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with ts-jest preset, coverage thresholds (80% MVP, 90% production), and WebSocket mocking setup
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with TypeScript + React rules, ignores variables prefixed with `_` for intentionally unused parameters
- **Metro Bundler**: React Native-optimized bundler config with TypeScript support and symlink handling
- **Example Expo App**: Expo Router v3 setup with TypeScript, separate from main library compilation
- **Stub Architecture**: All Phase 2+ components implemented as throwing stubs with proper TypeScript signatures

**Testing verification:**
```bash
‚úÖ npm run type-check  # TypeScript: 0 compilation errors
‚úÖ npm run build      # Generates proper dist/ files (JS + .d.ts)
‚úÖ npm run lint       # ESLint: Clean code quality checks
‚úÖ npm test          # Jest: 2/2 tests passing with proper exports
‚úÖ npm run dev       # TypeScript watch mode working
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Gotchas & Future Reference**

1. **Package Version Conflicts**: React Native peer dependencies are notoriously finicky. We locked to specific versions:
   - `@types/react: ~18.2.79` (not ^19.x which conflicts with RN 0.73)
   - `react-native: ^0.73.0` peerDependency (not >=0.72 which causes resolution issues)
   - **FOOTGUN**: Always use `~` for React types, not `^`, to avoid major version conflicts

2. **Jest Configuration Pitfalls**:
   - **FOOTGUN**: Cannot use both `testMatch` and `testRegex` - Jest will error
   - **FOOTGUN**: `moduleNameMapping` is wrong property name, must be `moduleNameMapper`
   - **CRITICAL**: Must explicitly ignore Elixir directories (`assets/`, `lib/`, etc.) or Jest tries to parse `.ex` files as JS
   - **ts-jest vs react-native preset**: Used ts-jest for library development instead of react-native preset to avoid Metro dependencies

3. **ESLint React Native Community Config Issues**:
   - **FOOTGUN**: `@react-native-community/eslint-config` has broken jest/globals environment in some versions
   - **SOLUTION**: Built custom config with essential plugins only (`@typescript-eslint`, `react`, `react-hooks`)
   - **CONVENTION**: Use `_variableName` prefix for intentionally unused parameters in stubs

4. **TypeScript Configuration Traps**:
   - **FOOTGUN**: `noEmit: true` prevents build output generation - must be `false` for library
   - **CRITICAL**: Exclude `example/` from main tsconfig to avoid Expo dependency conflicts
   - **FUTURE**: Path aliases `@/*` set up for cleaner imports when implementing

5. **Metro vs TypeScript Build**:
   - **DECISION**: Metro for React Native apps, TypeScript compiler for library distribution
   - **FUTURE**: When implementing Phase 2, Metro will handle the example app bundling separately

6. **Stub Implementation Pattern**:
   - **CONVENTION**: All unimplemented functions throw with "Phase X.Y" reference for tracking
   - **TESTING**: Stubs export proper TypeScript signatures so integration tests pass
   - **FOOTGUN**: Don't import React unnecessarily in pure TypeScript files (triggers unused import lint errors)

### üéØ **Ready for Phase 1.2**
- All tooling verified and working
- Development workflow established
- Zero technical debt from setup phase
- Clear error messages point to next implementation phases

## ‚úÖ **Phase 1.2: Analyze & Adapt LiveReact Core**

### üìã **Implementation Details & Testing**

**What was implemented:**
- **LiveReactNative Module**: Created mobile-adapted version of LiveReact that returns data structures instead of HTML
- **Component Name Extraction**: Separates component name (`assigns.name`) from regular props to avoid conflicts
- **Props/Slots Extraction**: Reused and adapted original LiveReact logic with mobile-specific modifications
- **Mobile Slots System**: Created `LiveReactNative.Slots` that renders to plain text instead of HTML for JSON serialization
- **Consistent ID Generation**: Per-component ID generation that reuses IDs for same component in same process
- **Change Tracking**: Preserved LiveView's efficient change tracking system for mobile context
- **No SSR**: Completely removed server-side rendering as it's not applicable to mobile apps

**Testing verification:**
```bash
‚úÖ mix test test/live_react_native_test.exs  # 10/10 LiveReactNative tests passing
‚úÖ mix test                                 # 23/23 total tests (including existing LiveReact)
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Gotchas & Future Reference**

1. **Component Name vs Props Conflict**:
   - **ISSUE**: Key named "name" serves dual purposes - component name AND potential prop
   - **SOLUTION**: Extract component name first, then remove it from assigns before prop extraction
   - **FOOTGUN**: Don't let component name leak into props or it breaks React Native integration

2. **Separate Normalization Functions**:
   - **ISSUE**: `extract_props/1` standalone function vs `react_native/1` context need different "name" handling
   - **SOLUTION**: Created `normalize_key_for_extraction/2` that doesn't treat "name" as special
   - **PATTERN**: Standalone utility functions vs context-specific functions may need different rules

3. **Change Tracking Edge Cases**:
   - **ISSUE**: `key_changed?/2` must handle missing `__changed__` key gracefully
   - **SOLUTION**: Added catch-all clause that defaults to `true` for missing change tracking
   - **FOOTGUN**: Missing `__changed__` key can cause function clause errors

4. **Mobile Slot Rendering**:
   - **DECISION**: Render slots to plain text instead of HTML for JSON serialization
   - **LIMITATION**: Only supports default slot (inner_block), no named slots yet
   - **FUTURE**: May need to expand slot support based on React Native children patterns

5. **ID Generation Strategy**:
   - **REQUIREMENT**: Same component must get same ID in same process (for React Native reconciliation)
   - **IMPLEMENTATION**: Process-local cache of component name ‚Üí ID mappings
   - **CONSIDERATION**: Process memory grows with unique component names (acceptable for mobile app lifecycle)

6. **Data Structure Design**:
   - **OUTPUT**: Returns map with `%{component_name, id, props, slots, props_changed?, slots_changed?}`
   - **SERIALIZATION**: Entire output must be JSON-serializable for Phoenix Channel transmission
   - **FUTURE**: This structure will be sent over WebSocket to React Native client

### üéØ **Ready for Phase 1.3**
- Mobile-adapted LiveView API complete and tested
- Data structures designed for channel transmission
- Zero breaking changes to existing web LiveReact
- Clear separation between web (HTML) and mobile (data) rendering paths
