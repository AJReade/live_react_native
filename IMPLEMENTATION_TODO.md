# üß¨ LiveReact Native - Implementation TODO

## üß™ Test-Driven Development Approach

**üö® CRITICAL: Every implementation step MUST start with tests first!**

### TDD Workflow for Each Task:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests that specify the expected behavior
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: Continue with next test case

### Test Categories:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: LiveView ‚Üî React Native communication
- **E2E Tests**: Full user scenarios in example app
- **Performance Tests**: Memory, rendering, network efficiency

## üìù Documentation Rules

**üö® AFTER COMPLETING EACH SECTION: Document in [`IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md)**

Required for every completed phase:
- **What was implemented** (technical details)
- **How it was tested** (verification commands)
- **Critical gotchas** (footguns and future reference warnings)
- **Lessons learned** (patterns and conventions established)

## üìù Notes

- **üß™ TDD FIRST**: Every feature starts with failing tests - NO EXCEPTIONS!
- **üìã DOCUMENT AFTER COMPLETION**: Update [`IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md) after each section
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Follow TDD cycle religiously for all tasks
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >90% test coverage before any release
- **Priority**: Focus on getting basic component rendering + events working first
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize early and often (with performance tests)
- **Community**: Engage with LiveView and React Native communities for feedback

### üö® TDD Enforcement Rules:
1. **No implementation without tests first**
2. **All tests must fail initially (RED phase)**
3. **Write minimal code to pass tests (GREEN phase)**
4. **Refactor only when tests are green**
5. **Every bug fix starts with a failing test that reproduces the bug**

### üìö Documentation Workflow:
1. **Complete section tasks** in this TODO
2. **Document implementation** in [`IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md)
3. **Include gotchas & footguns** for future reference
4. **Update README** if needed
